socket.io Actionscript client
============================

This is fork from Matt Kane implementation that did not work for me. I ported javascript SockeytIO code to actionscript and it works fine now on yatv.ru.
The WebSocket part is taken from javascript soketIO implementations with litle modifications.

If you need help please feel free to contact me zallesov@gmail.com. Maybe i'll write better readme with examples after that.
