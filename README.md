socket.io Actionscript client
============================
#### By Matt Kane

This is a client for [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO/) implemented in Actionscript 3. It allows you to connect to the socket server from your Adobe AIR/Flex application. I've tested it in AIR but it should probably work in regular Flex, subject to crossdomain policies.

### Usage
I've tried to follow the same API as the socket.io javascript client. This is a simple example of connecting to a socket.

    socket = new SocketIo("127.0.0.1", {port: 8080});
    socket.addEventListener(IoDataEvent.DATA, function(e:IoDataEvent):void {
        trace(e.messageData);
    });
    socket.connect();
    socket.send("Hi!");
 
For a full example, look at Example.mxml, which is a Flex/AIR port of the socket.io chat demo. You'll need to be running the chat demo server for this to work. See the main socket.io project for details of this.

Compile and run it like so:

    amxmlc Example.mxml
    adl example.xml
    
### Requirements
Obviously, you'll need the Flex and/or AIR SDK. You also need a couple of libraries.

+ [as3corelib](https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib)
+ [as3crypto](http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/)

Install these either as compiled .swcs in your flex library folder, or as source in this folder.
